\begin{itemize}
    \item Functional programming is super cool, but it has its limits. We resorted to using a
          StringMap reference (which behaves like a global variable of sorts) to keep track of what
          functions are bound to the properties of object variables. I'm sure there's a
          functional way to do that, but this approach made the most sense to us.
    \item Start early, on everything! Code generation can get particularly hairy.
    \item The OCaml LLVM API can be pretty confusing, so be sure to ask your advisor a bunch
          of questions if you can't figure out how to get something working.
    \item Temper your expectations from the beginning. Your language should only have a handful of
          core features are unique and super exciting - don't promise too much!

\begin{itemize}
\item Even after been warned multiple times, I still have the habit of not starting the real work
until the last minute.
\item Functional programming is fun in a way that it forces me to think in completely different
patterns.
\item (As advice for future students as well) Learn to manage the expectations. As initially
planned, Propeller was clearly way too ambitious, even with GUIs, high-level list operations and
all the bells and whistles. As time flew by, some of the goals are clearly unrealistic for a
semester-long project and had to be dropped.
\item (When implementing external object bindings) If searching something gives no useful results,
and all hope is lost, trying all possible combinations could be a good way to go.
\item Test-oriented development can be beneficial, but could result in a compiler that doesn't work
with code that uses any untested features.
\item Function pointers in LLVM causes even more confusion than function pointers in C++.
\item I feel like as a team made of complete strangers, we could use more communication throughout
the project.
\end{itemize}
