\section{Introduction}

Propeller is a language designed to write programs using the reactive programming paradigm. Programs
written in Propeller usually act upon external events such as user inputs and environmental changes.
Most prominently, it features a binding system: functions can be bound to properties (akin to members
or fields in other languages) of objects (akin to records or structs in other languages) such that a
change in the value of a property results in a call to each of its bound functions.

Propeller has multiple runtime environments: a simple runtime with a fixed entry point, and one that
monitors certain local parameters of the computer (e.g. CPU temperature sensor readings). Given other
runtime environments, Propeller can be extended to interface with any external input, such as
that from a GUI, or from another kind of sensor.
