\section{Built-in Functions and Standard Library}

This section gives a tentative feature set of built-in functions and the standard library of
Propeller.

Built-in functions will offer mathematical calculations such as trigonometric functions
(\verb|sin|, \verb|cos|, \verb|tan|, \verb|fabs|, \verb|exp|, \verb|log|),
terminating execution with exit code (\verb|exit|), printing values of primitive types
(\verb|print_int|, \verb|print_float|, \verb|print_str|),
as well as basic list operations (\verb|empty?|, \verb|first|, \verb|rest|, \verb|length| the last of which
behave like \verb|car| and \verb|cdr| in some functional languages).

Using these built-in functions, will provide additional features such as
string manipulation, printing values in lists, and more advanced list operations. The standard
library will be implemented using Propeller itself, and included implicitly in every program.
