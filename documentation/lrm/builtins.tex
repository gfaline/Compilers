\section{Built-in Functions and Standard Library}

This section gives a tentative feature set of built-in functions and the standard library of
Propeller.

Functions that are built-in will offer mathematical calculations such as trigonometric functions
(\verb|sin|, \verb|cos|, \verb|tan|, \verb|fabs|, \verb|exp|, \verb|log|),
terminating execution with exit code (\verb|exit|), printing values of primitive types
(\verb|print_int|, \verb|print_float|, \verb|print_str|),
as well as basic list operations (\verb|empty?|, \verb|first|, \verb|rest|, the last two behave
like \verb|car| and \verb|cdr| in some functional languages).

The standard library, built upon these built-in functions, will provide extra features such as
string manipulation, printing values in lists, and some more advanced list operations. The standard
library will be implemented using Propeller itself, and included implicitly in every program.
